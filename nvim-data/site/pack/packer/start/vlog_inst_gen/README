This script is used for automatically generating verilog instance from the file. When you type the given hot-key, instance will be copied to system clipboard, and display or not by  its working mode. Once your file can access syntax check, this plunin will work, or there must be a bug. It's encouraged to share it with me and all other people.

Supported working mode:
    mode 0(default): 
        copy inst to clipboard and echo inst in commandline
    mode 1:
        only copy to clipboard
    mode 2:
        copy to clipboard and echo inst in split window
    mode 3:
        copy to clipboard and update inst_comment to file
    
  To change the default working mode, you should modify the line in this script "let g:vlog_inst_gen_mode=x", x is the default working mode; or you can add  "let g:vlog_inst_gen_mode=x" to your _vimrc or .vimrc file.

        VlogInstGen : generate verilog instance
        VlogInstMod : change working mode
Default hot-keys:
